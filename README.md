# SVM_Dog_vs_Cat
🐶🐱 Dog vs Cat Image Classification using SVM
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying images of Dogs and Cats 🐾 using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier built with Python and Scikit-Learn.

It demonstrates image preprocessing, feature flattening, model training, and single image prediction using a small dataset.
